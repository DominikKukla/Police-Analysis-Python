# Police Data Analysis Project

Welcome to my Python Data Analysis Portfolio project! This repository contains a data cleaning, EDA, and visualization project made using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib libraries.

This project serves as a demonstration of my Python skills for data analysis. It highlights what I've learned thus far within Python regarding data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and creating visualizations.

## Overview

The project is divided into three complementary parts, each of which consists of Jupyter Notebook cells with Python code.

- **Part 1: Data Cleaning** - An in-depth process of cleaning dirty data for an upcoming analysis consisting of standardisation, splitting, and type conversion.

- **Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis** - Fiddling with the previously cleaned data in order to discover meaningful insights via methods like researching the distribution of data between columns, aggregating the data,checking for correlaions, and identifying Trends and Patterns. This part contains partial conclusions gathered from EDA.

- **Part 3: Data Visualizations and Conclusions** - Utilizes visualizations such as charts and graphs to effectively communicate insights derived from the analysis, accompanied by a summary of key findings and trends based on the data.
